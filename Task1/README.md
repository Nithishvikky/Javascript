## New things learned
- `LocalStorage` - Brushed up the concept and methods **setItem(),getItem(),removeItem() and clear()**. 
- `DOM Manipulation` - Studied how to Manipulate the DOM by using JS. I used to work in **React**. Now I understood the **DOM** Concept and how it works.
- `Array Methods` - There are plenty of array functions So I grasp some of them which is more important such as **push(),splice(),forEach(),map() and filter()**.
- `Template Literals` - Using **${}** to dynamically insert values into HTML.
